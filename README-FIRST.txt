Time Study Desk / Video work analysis
===================================

Read README.md or README.ja.md for the current development scope.
Read AGENTS.md, APP_SPEC.md, and the plan under docs/superpowers/plans/ before editing.

v0.7.0 adds time-table, summary and interval-detail CSV exports with explicit missing/state semantics and spreadsheet-text hardening.
Count-aware statistics, video-evidence review, repeated cycles, exceptions, preserved procedures, interval editing, JSON import/export and browser-local recovery are retained.
Mobile/accessibility completion remains the next development milestone.

Edit src/index.template.html, not generated HTML.
On Windows run build-standalone.bat, or the syntax/repository checks documented in README.
Use the freshly generated dist/index.html, dist/index.self-extract.html, or time-study-desk.html.
Keep videos local. No runtime library or WebRTC integration is used by this app.
Review the associated Actions run for exact build, test, and screenshot evidence.
The user merges the PR. Do not merge, publish a release/tag, or change Browser Kitty itself.
